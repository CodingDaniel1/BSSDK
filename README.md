# BSSDK
This is the official Banana Shooter SDK for creating custom models.

To make sure your custom models will be loaded correctly you will have to make sure your .unity3d files name are source.unity3d, otherwise the game wont load it, also you have to create a config.json along with it, the config.json should look like this

```json
{
  "name" : "your models name or whatever you want to show in the game"
}
```

Tutorials will be added later
